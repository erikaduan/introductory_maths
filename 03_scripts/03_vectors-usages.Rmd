# Vector norms  

To measure vectors, you can think about the norm (i.e. length) of the vector as the distance between its origin and end points.     

$\lVert x \rVert = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2+...+x_n^2}$   

Norms are functions that map vectors to non-negative values. They are used to assign $length\; \lVert x\rVert \in {\rm I\!R}$ to a vector $x$.        

A norm has to satisfy the following three properties:  

+ It is absolutely homogeneous. For all scalars that are real values, the length scales proportionally with the value of the scalar. $\forall \alpha \in {\rm I\!R}, \; \lVert \alpha x \rVert = \lVert \alpha \rVert \times \lVert x \rVert$           
+ It exhibits triangular inequality. In geometric terms, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater or at least equal to the length of the third side. $\lVert x+y \rVert \leq \lVert x \rVert + \lVert y \rVert$.            
+ It is positively defined. The length of $x$ has to be a positive value and a length of zero only occurs if $x = 0$.      
$\lVert x \rVert \geq 0$   
$\lVert x \rVert = 0 \iff x = 0$           

The three main types of vector norms are illustrated below.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/02_vectors-norm-types.jpg")   
```


## Euclidean norm    

The Euclidean or $L_2$ norm is defined below. 
$$\lVert x\rVert_2 := \sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} = \sqrt{x^T\times x}$$  

The euclidean norm can also be thought of as the square root of the dot product of a vector by itself.  

In 2D, the Euclidean norm is $\lVert x\rVert_2 \in {\rm I\!R}^2 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$.   
This is equivalent to the Pythagoras theorem for calculating the hypotenuse of a triangle with sides $x_1^2$ and $x_2^2$.    

```{python}
#-----calculate L2 norm in Python via NumPy-----  
import numpy as np  

x = np.array([[3],
              [-4]])  
              
np.linalg.norm(x, 2) 
#> 5.0  
```

```{r}
#-----calculate L2 norm in R-----  
x <- matrix(c(3, -4), nrow = 2)

norm(x, type = "2")
#> [1] 5 
```



## Manhattan norm   

The Manhattan or $L_1$ norm is analogous to measuring distances whilst moving in only vertical and horizontal lines. It is defined below.    
$$\lVert x\rVert_1 := \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i|$$   

The manhattan norm is preferred for discriminating between elements that are exactly zero and elements that are small but not zero (or in machine learning, for calculating a distance matrix between categorical data points).     

```{python}
#-----calculate L1 norm in Python via NumPy-----  
x = np.array([[3],
              [-4]])  
              
np.linalg.norm(x, 1) 
#> 7.0 

# |3| + |-4| = 7  
```

```{r}
#-----calculate L1 norm in R-----  
x <- matrix(c(3, -4), nrow = 2)

norm(x, type = "O")
#> [1] 7   
```


## Max norm     

The Max norm or infinity norm is the absolute value of the largest element in the vector. It is defined below.  
$$\lVert x\rVert_\infty := max_i|x_i|$$   

The max norm is a useful norm type as when the number of dimensions increases, the vector length will be disproportionately influenced by the largest vector shown from the equation below.    
$$\lVert x\rVert_p := \sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^p}$$      

```{python}
#-----calculate max norm in Python via NumPy-----  
x = np.array([[3],
              [-4]])  
              
np.linalg.norm(x, np.inf) 

#> 4.0 
```

```{r}
#-----calculate max norm in R-----
x <- matrix(c(3, -4), nrow = 2)

norm(x, type = "O")
#> [1] 4  
```


# Vector inner product, length and distance    

For practicality, you can consider the vector inner product and the vector dot product as the same thing. Every dot product is an inner product. In ${\rm I\!R}^n$, the inner product is a dot product defined below.    
$$\langle 
\begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  \vdots \\
  x_n
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
  y_1 \\
  \vdots \\
  y_n
\end{bmatrix}
\rangle := x \cdot y = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\times y_i$$  

Because length is a concept from geometry, you can say that geometric vectors have lengths and that vectors in ${\rm I\!R}^n$ have norms.   

Distance is a relational concept, as it refers to the length of the difference between two vectors. For example, consider the vectors $x$ and $y$. We define the distance $d(x, y)$ as below.    
$$d(x, y) := \lVert x - y \rVert = \sqrt{\langle x-y, x -y \rangle}$$     

This definition for distance is flexible. When the inner product is specifically the dot product, the distance equals to the Euclidean distance.   
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/02_vectors-distance.jpg")   
```

```{python}
#-----calculate L2 distance between two vectors in Python via NumPy-----  
x = np.array([[3],
              [2]])   

y = np.array([[-2],
              [2]])

x - y 
#> array([[5],
#>        [0]])

distance = np.linalg.norm(x - y, 2)

print("L2 distance between x and y: {}".format(distance))
#> L2 distance between x and y: 5.0   
```

```{r}
#-----calculate L2 distance between two vectors in R-----
x <- matrix(c(3, 2), nrow = 2)

y <- matrix(c(-2, 2), nrow = 2)   

x - y
#>      [,1]
#> [1,]    5
#> [2,]    0 

norm(x - y, type = "2")
#> [1] 5    
```


# Vector angles  

The Cauchyâ€“Schwarz inequality is used to define the behaviour of angles between a pair of vectors, and is stated below.    
$|\langle x,y \rangle| \leq \lVert x \rVert \lVert y \rVert$    

It describes an important behaviour of vectors, namely that the dot product of two vectors is always smaller than or equal to the product of their lengths.  

When two vectors are co-linear (i.e. lie on the same line), $|\langle x,y \rangle| = \lVert x \rVert \lVert y \rVert$.    

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/02_vectors-cauchy-schwarz.jpg")     
```

We can think of the definition of the angle between two vectors as a generalisation of the Cosine rule.    
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/02_vectors-cosine.jpg")     
```

Because $|\langle x,y \rangle| \leq \lVert x \rVert \lVert y \rVert$, we can further define the range of values for which $\cos\theta$ is valid.     

$$-1 \leq \frac{\langle x, y\rangle}{\lVert x\rVert \lVert y \rVert} \leq 1$$ 

A maximum of 1 represents a co-linear scenario where two vectors point in the same direction. A minimum of -1 also represents a situation where one vector points in the opposite direction (but both vectors are still co-linear). All other values fall in between this range and a value of 0 represents an orthogonal vector pair. 

**Note:** The dot product of two vectors can be a negative number (this simply reflects relational vector direction).    

```{python}
#-----calculate cos(theta) of two vectors in Python via NumPy-----  
import math

x = np.array([[1],
              [5]]) 

y = np.array([[8],
              [2]])

cos_theta = (np.transpose(x) @ y)/ (np.linalg.norm(x, 2) * np.linalg.norm(y, 2))  

print("cos(theta) of vectors x and y: {}".format(cos_theta))
#> cos(theta) of vectors x and y: [[0.42808634]]  

#-----calculate radians and convert to degrees-----   
math.acos(cos_theta) # returns theta in radians   
#> 1.1284221038181517

math.acos(cos_theta) * ((180)/np.pi) # convert theta to angle  
#> 64.6538240580533  

# 1 radians = 180/np.pi degrees
```

```{r}
#-----calculate cos(theta) of two vectors in R-----    
x <- matrix(c(1, 5), nrow = 2)  

y <- matrix(c(8, 2), nrow = 2)
  
cos_theta <- (t(x) %*% y) / (norm(x, type = "2") * norm(y, type = "2")) 

#-----calculate radians and convert to degrees-----    
radians <- acos(cos_theta)

degrees <- radians * 180/pi
degrees
#>          [,1]
#> [1,] 64.65382
```


# Vector orthogonality    

Vector orthogonality is used to describe vector perpendicularity to vectors in any number of dimensions. Mathematically, a pair of vectors $x$ and $y$ are orthogonal ($x\perp y$) if:   

+ $\langle x, y\rangle \; or \; x\cdot y = 0$  
+ In a 2D plane, this also means that the angle between $x$ and $y$ is 90 degrees as $\langle x, y\rangle = \cos \theta \times \lVert x\rVert \lVert y\rVert$ and $\cos 90 = 0$.        

```{python}
#-----create function to assess vector orthogonality in Python-----  
# 90 degrees is 90 * np.pi/180 radians

def is_orthogonal(x, y):
  assert(type(x).__module__ == np.__name__), "Vector x is not a NumPy array"   
  assert(type(y).__module__ == np.__name__), "Vector y is not a NumPy array"   
  assert(x.ndim == 2), "Vector x should be 2D"    
  assert(y.ndim == 2), "Vector y should be 2D"   
  
  cos_theta = (np.transpose(x) @ y) / (np.linalg.norm(x, 2) * np.linalg.norm(y, 2))
  radians = math.acos(cos_theta)
  
  if radians == 90 * np.pi/180:
    return(True)
  else: 
    return(False)
  
x = np.array([[2],
              [0]]) 
              
y = np.array([[0],
              [2]])

is_orthogonal(x, y)
#> True
```

```{r}
#-----create function to assess vector orthogonality in R-----  
is_orthogonal <- function(x, y) {
  stopifnot(class(x)[1]=="matrix")
  stopifnot(class(y)[1]=="matrix")
  
  cos_theta <- (t(x) %*% y) / (norm(x, type = "2") * norm(y, type = "2"))
  radians <- acos(cos_theta)
  
  if_else(radians == 90 * pi/180, return(TRUE), return(FALSE))
}

x <- matrix(c(2, 0), nrow = 2)
y <- matrix(c(0, 2), nrow = 2)

is_orthogonal(x, y)
#> [1] TRUE  
```


# Systems of linear equations     

Linear algebra is used to solve systems of linear equations, or to work out the right combination (i.e. weights) of linear segments to obtain an outcome.  

For example, the question of what ingredient proportions are acceptable for making pancakes can be reconstructed as a linear equation.     

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/02_vectors-pancake.jpg")     
```

A system of linear equations involve multiple equations that need to be solved simultaneously.   
$x + 2y = 8$  
$5x - 3y = 1$   

In the example above, we have a linear algebra system with two unknowns, $x$ and $y$. Geometrically, both equations can be re-written to produce a straight line in the 2D plane.    
$y=-\frac{1}{2}x+4$      
$y=\frac{5}{3}x-\frac{1}{3}$       
    
The point where two both linears equations intersect is the solution to the linear system.     

```{python, out.width = '60%'}
#-----plot system of linear equations in Python-----    
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns    

x = np.arange(-10, 10, 1)
y_1 = (-1/2 * x) + 4  
y_2 = (5/3 * x) - (1/3)    

# Python allows you to directly plot NumPy array values  

sns.set_style('whitegrid', {
              'grid.linestyle': '--'})

sns.lineplot(x, y_1, label = "x + 2y = 8", lw = 2)    
sns.lineplot(x, y_2, label = "5x - 3y = 1", lw = 2)   

plt.xlabel("x")  
plt.ylabel("y1, y2")
plt.legend(loc = "upper right")
plt.show()
```

```{r, out.width = '60%'}
#-----plot system of linear equations in R-----  
x = seq(-10, 10, 1)
y_1 = (-1/2 * x) + 4  
y_2 = (5/3 * x) - (1/3) # brackets for readability   

linalg_plot <- tibble(x,
                      y_1,
                      y_2)   

ggplot(linalg_plot, aes(x, y_1)) +
  geom_line(colour = "steelblue") +
  geom_line(aes(x, y_2), colour = "firebrick") + 
  labs(y = "y1, y2") +

        panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = "dotted")) +

  annotate("text", x = -8, y = -10, label = "5x - 3y = 1", colour = "firebrick")

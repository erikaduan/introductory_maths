# Introduction to triangles     

A brief revision of triangles is shown below. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/02_vectors-angles-revision-1.jpg")   
```

Triangles and angles are an important mathematical concept to revise, as vector similarity is calculated based on concepts from geometry and trigonometry. The definition of vector norms i.e. $||x||$ and how they behave is also derived from insights from trigonometry.     


# Triangle inequality theorem      

Any side of a triangle must be shorter than the other two sides added together. If the side is equal to the other two sides, the length of one side is 0 and the object is a line.   

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/02_vectors-angles-revision-2.jpg")   
```


# Sine, Cosine and Tangent    

Sine, Cosine and Tangent are just a ratio of two specific sides of a right angled triangle. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/02_vectors-angles-revision-3.jpg")   
```

We are therefore only interested in values $0\leq \measuredangle \leq 90$ and the values for Sine and Cosine will always be between 0 and 1 (as the hypotenus is always equal to or larger than the opposite and the adjacent).  

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/02_vectors-angles-revision-4.jpg")   
```

```{python}
#-----draw sine and cosine function in Python-----   
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns  

x = np.arange(-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, 0.1) 
sine = np.sin(x)
cosine = np.cos(x)

# Python allows you to directly plot NumPy array values  

sns.set_style('whitegrid', {
              'grid.linestyle': '--'})

sns.lineplot(x = x, y = sine, label = "Sine wave", lw = 3)
sns.lineplot(x = x, y = cosine, label = "Cosine wave", lw = 3)

plt.xlabel("x")  
plt.ylabel("sin(x) and cos(x)")
plt.legend(loc = "upper right")
plt.show()
```


```{r, out.width = '60%'}
#-----draw sine and cosine function in R-----
x <- c(seq(-2*pi, 2*pi, length.out = 100))

sine <- sin(x) # calculate sine
cosine <- cos(x) # calculate cosine  

trig_plot <- tibble(x,
                    sine,
                    cosine)

  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 0.9, label = "Cosine wave", colour = "firebrick")

# The Sine rule  

The [Sine rule](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-sine-law.html) is useful for solving triangle angles and lengths, but does not have any direct application to machine learning algorithms.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/02_vectors-angles-revision-5.jpg")   
```


# The Cosine rule  

In contrast, the [Cosine rule](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-cosine-law.html) is particularly useful for calculating object similarity in machine learning, as it can be applied to calculate the angle between two lengths, given that all lengths are known.   

In trigonometry, the Cosine rule can be derived to find either an unknown length given that two sides and the angle between them are knownn, or an unknown angle given that all sides of the triangle are known.     

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/02_vectors-angles-revision-6.jpg")   
```

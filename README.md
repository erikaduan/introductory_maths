# Introductory mathematics in R and Python

This repository contains tutorials on the introductory mathematical concepts required for studying statistics and machine learning.

## Aim

The **primary aim** of this repository is to help data scientists to revise the mathematical concepts required for understanding machine learning and statistics.

This repository also has a **secondary aim** of promoting code agnostic practices, by highlighting how the same functions can be performed in both R and Python using the R `reticulate` package.

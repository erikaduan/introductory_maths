# Introductory mathematics in R and Python  

This repository contains a series of tutorials designed to help R users explore introductory mathematical concepts.  

## Aim:  

The **primary aim** of this repository is to provide resources to help R users who are interested in practicing machine learning but do not come from a mathematics background/ have forgotten all their specialist mathematics knowledge (i.e. designed to help someone like me).  

This repository also has a **secondary aim** of promoting code agnostic practices, by highlighting how the same functions can be performed in both R and Python.

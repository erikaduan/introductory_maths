# Introduction to probability

Probability is an abstract concept. The frequentist approach considers
probability as the relative frequency of a specific outcome. The
Bayesian approach considers probability as a subjective term composed of
a prior hypothesis and the observed evidence.

However, probability can be broadly thought of as the size of a
mathematical set (which can be represented in 2D as a proportion of
total space).

## Set properties

### Scenario 1

Imagine that we simultaneously roll two fair dice. What is the
probability that the sum of two dice equals 5?

-   We would first need to calculate all possible combinations of the
    dice rolls. The total number of possible combinations is the
    **sample space** i.e.Â the set of all possible outcomes. As there are
    6 faces on one dice and we are rolling two dice, the sample space is
    ![6\\times6](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?6%5Ctimes6 "6\times6")
    or ![6^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?6%5E2 "6^2").

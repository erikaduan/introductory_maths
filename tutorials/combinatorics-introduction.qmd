## Summary

This tutorial explains how to use factorials, permutations and combinations to count object combination possibilities. It also covers more advanced scenarios involving distinct object partitioning, non-distinct object combinations, lattice path applications and Pascal's identity applications. Combinatorial analysis is a prerequisite for calculating event probabilities using the sample-point method.

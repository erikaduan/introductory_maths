## Summary

This tutorial provides a framework for describing element belonging to a set, where a set is a collection of distinct elements. Working with sets is a prerequisite for understanding the key properties of probability theory.

# What is a set?  

A set is a collection of distinct objects or elements ($e$). We reference a set by listing all its elements. *For example, $S = \{cat, \;mouse, \;dog \}$ or $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$ to describe all the possible distinct outcomes when we roll a dice and observe its upper face.*      

Set notation:   

-   An example of a finite set is $A = \{1, 3, 5 \}$. A finite set is countable by definition.   
-   An example of a countably infinite set is $B = \{1, 2, \cdots \}$. The set consists of integers which extend fro to infinity.    
-   An example of an uncountably infinite set is $C = (1, 0)$. The set is uncountable as it comprises all real numbers between 0 and 1.  
-   The **null set** ($\varnothing$) does not contain any elements and is denoted by $\varnothing = \{\}$.   
-   $S$ is used to denote the universal set, which is the set of all objects under consideration.  
-   The complement of set $A$ is the set of elements which are in $S$ but not in $A$. This is expressed in mathematical notation as $\bar{A} = \{e : e\in S, e\notin A\}$.   
-   If all elements of set $A$ are also in set $B$, set $A$ is a subset of set $B$ and this is denoted as $A \subseteq B$. There are only two possibilities when this is true, that the number of elements in set A are fewer than those in set B or that set A and B contain the same elements.   
-   If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$, then $A = B$.

# Working with two or more sets   

Venn diagrams are useful for conceptually visualising set properties. However, we still want to use rigorous mathematical proofs when asserting set properties.

## R

R does not have a set data type.  

```{r}
# Compute inequality in R ------------------------------------------------------
4 <= 4
#> [1] TRUE

4 < 4
#> [1] FALSE

class(4 < 4)
#> [1] "logical"
```

## Python

In Python, inequality statements are also outputted as Boolean values i.e. `True` or `False`.

```{python}
# Compute inequality in Python -------------------------------------------------
4 <= 4
#> True 

type(4 <= 4)
#> <class 'bool'>  
```

## Julia

In Julia, inequality statements are also outputted as Boolean values i.e. `true` or `false`.

```{julia}
# Compute inequality in Julia --------------------------------------------------
4 <= 4
#> true 

typeof(4 <= 4) 
#> true
#> Bool

a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

a < b, a + c < b + c
#> (true, true) 
```

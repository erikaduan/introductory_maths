# Numbers

Numbers are used to:

-   Count objects. *For example, I have 10 tutorials to read.*  
-   Describe object behaviour. *For example, the area of a unit circle
    is $\pi r^2$ where $r = 1$.*  
-   Solve problems, often by introducing simple assumptions. *For
    example, if 5 bees can pollinate a $100 m^2$ field in 10 minutes,
    how many bees are required to pollinate a 350 $m^2$ field? Assume
    that pollination efficiency scales perfectly and is not impacted by
    land shape.*  
-   Represent complex abstractions. *For example, how can individual
    words be represented in an n-dimensional feature space?*

Numbers can be classified into different categories according to their
properties. A number can belong to multiple categories. For example, the
number 2 is a **count** (a natural number) and a **whole number** (an
integer), and can be represented as a **fraction** i.e. $\tfrac{2}{1}$
(a rational number) and a **complex number** i.e. $3+i^2$.

Number classifications have an elegant hierarchical property:

-   All natural numbers are integers.  
-   All integers are rational numbers i.e. $n = \tfrac{n}{1}$.  
-   All rational numbers are complex numbers
    i.e. $\tfrac{n}{1} = \tfrac{n}{1}+0i$.

# Numbers

Numbers are used to:

-   Count objects. *For example, I have 10 tutorials to read.*  
-   Describe object behaviour. *For example, the area of a unit circle
    is*
    ![\pi r^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cpi%20r%5E2 "\pi r^2")
    where
    ![r = 1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r%20%3D%201 "r = 1").  
-   Solve problems, often by introducing simple assumptions. *For
    example, if 5 bees can pollinate a*
    ![100 m^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?100%20m%5E2 "100 m^2")
    field in 10 minutes, how many bees are required to pollinate a 350
    ![m^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?m%5E2 "m^2") field?
    Assume that pollination efficiency scales perfectly and is not
    impacted by land shape.  
-   Represent complex abstractions. *For example, how can individual
    words be represented in an n-dimensional feature space?*

Numbers can be classified into different categories according to their
properties. A number can belong to multiple categories. For example, the
number 2 is a **count** (a natural number) and a **whole number** (an
integer), and can be represented as a **fraction**
i.e. ![\tfrac{2}{1}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7B1%7D "\tfrac{2}{1}")
(a rational number) and a **complex number**
i.e. ![3+i^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?3%2Bi%5E2 "3+i^2").

Number classifications have an elegant hierarchical property:

-   All natural numbers are integers.  
-   All integers are rational numbers
    i.e. ![n = \tfrac{n}{1}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n%20%3D%20%5Ctfrac%7Bn%7D%7B1%7D "n = \tfrac{n}{1}").  
-   All rational numbers are complex numbers
    i.e. ![\tfrac{n}{1} = \tfrac{n}{1}+0i](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Ctfrac%7Bn%7D%7B1%7D%20%3D%20%5Ctfrac%7Bn%7D%7B1%7D%2B0i "\tfrac{n}{1} = \tfrac{n}{1}+0i").

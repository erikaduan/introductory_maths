## Summary  

This tutorial lists some common algebraic tricks, such as factorisation and working with inequalities, which are useful for solving mathematical problems in later tutorials.

# Elementary algebra   

Elementary algebra is commonly associated with questions like *Solve for x when $2x + y = 6$*. It is more useful, however, to think of elementary algebra as a form of expression that allows us to represent infinitely possible terms using finite ones.  

For example, the terms $6x + 3y$, $4x + 2y$ and $2x + y$ are equivalent and there are theoretically infinite variations of this expression, with the simplest being $2x + y$. When we read the term $2x + y$, we can intuit that 2 parts of $x$ and 1 part of $y$ are always required to make up a final quantity.

An algebraic term can therefore be decomposed into three parts:
-   A single **variable** or multiple variables. A variable is a varying quantity of an entity, usually represented by concise symbols $x$, $y$ or $x_i$.      
-   The relative **quantity** of each variable. *For example, let $x$ represent the number of eggs and $y$ represent the number of cups of sugar required to make a dessert.* The term $x + y$ describes a 1:1 ratio of eggs to sugar whereas the term $2x + y$ describes a 2:1 ratio of eggs to sugar and will result in a very different taste.  
-   The arithmetic **operator(s)** applied between variables. *For example, in additive models, the relationship between parameters $y = b_o+b_1x_1 + \cdots + b_nx_n$ is additive and the dependent variable $y$ therefore increases by $b_1$ amount for one unit increase in $x_1$.*

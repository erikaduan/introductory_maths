# Independent events

We previously learnt that two events can have overlapping elements or be
mutually exclusive (also known as being disjointed). An example of two
events being mutually exclusive is the observation that a coin can only
land on either heads or tails when tossed. Mutual exclusivity therefore
refers to the observation that only one or another distinct event is
possible in a single outcome, which is different to the concept of
independence.

When events are independent of each other, we refer to the observation
that two or more events have occurred, where the occurrence of one event
does not affect the occurrence of another event (also described as where
the probability of one event occurring does not change the probability
of another event occurring). An example of independence is the real
world knowledge that the outcome of two coin tosses are independent of
each other. The observation that the first coin lands on heads does not
increase the probability of the second coin also landing on heads,
because each coin toss has a set probability of landing on either heads
or tails.

# Conditional probability

The opposite of independent events is conditional probability. The
conditional probability of rain when the weather is cloudy or sunny is
denoted as
![P(rain\|cloudy)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.format?P%28rain%7Ccloudy%29 "P(rain|cloudy)")
or
![P(rain\|sunny)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.format?P%28rain%7Csunny%29 "P(rain|sunny)").

# Elementary algebra

Elementary algebra is commonly associated with questions like *Solve for
x when
![2x + y = 6](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?2x%20%2B%20y%20%3D%206 "2x + y = 6")*.
It is more useful, however, to think of elementary algebra as a form of
expression that allows us to represent infinitely possible terms using
finite ones.

For example, the terms
![6x + 3y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?6x%20%2B%203y "6x + 3y"),
![4x + 2y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?4x%20%2B%202y "4x + 2y")
and
![2x + y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?2x%20%2B%20y "2x + y")
are equivalent and there are theoretically infinite variations of this
expression, with the simplest being
![2x + y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?2x%20%2B%20y "2x + y").
When we read the term
![2x + y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?2x%20%2B%20y "2x + y"),
we can intuit that 2 parts of
![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x "x") and 1 part of
![y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y "y") are always required to
make up a final quantity.

An algebraic term can therefore be decomposed into three parts: - A
single **variable** or multiple variables. A variable is a varying
quantity of an entity, usually represented by concise symbols
![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x "x"),
![y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y "y") or
![x_i](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x_i "x_i").  
- The relative **quantity** of each variable. *For example, let
![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x "x") represent the number of
eggs and ![y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y "y") represent the
number of cups of sugar required to make a dessert.* The term
![x + y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%20%2B%20y "x + y")
describes a 1:1 ratio of eggs to sugar whereas the term
![2x + y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?2x%20%2B%20y "2x + y")
describes a 2:1 ratio of eggs to sugar and will result in a very
different taste.  
- The arithmetic **operator(s)** applied between variables. *For
example, in additive models, the relationship between parameters
![y = b_o+b_1x_1 + \cdots + b_nx_n](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y%20%3D%20b_o%2Bb_1x_1%20%2B%20%5Ccdots%20%2B%20b_nx_n "y = b_o+b_1x_1 + \cdots + b_nx_n")
is additive and the dependent variable
![y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y "y") therefore increases by
![b_1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?b_1 "b_1") amount for one
unit increase in
![x_1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x_1 "x_1").*

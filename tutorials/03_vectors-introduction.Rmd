# What is a vector?  

A single vector can be thought of as an ordered and finite list of numbers.   
$[\,2,\, 1\,]^\mathsf{T}$ represents a vector which is `+2` rightwards and `+1` above `(0,0)` in the Cartesian plane.   
The vector $[\,2,\, 1,\, 1\,]^\mathsf{T}$ has three dimensions and points to a single location in 3D space.     

Vectors can have any number of dimensions and are mathematical objects that can be added or multiplied by a scalar i.e. transformed into another vector.    

Individual vectors represent single observations and can be viewed as the fundamental unit of data in machine learning. You can think of simple machine learning methods as mathematical approaches for inferring patterns regarding how vectors co-exist within a space defined by $n$ dimensions. 

Different types of vectors exist:  

+ Geometrical vectors - lines with directions.        
+ [Polynomials](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/polynomials.html) - an algebraic expression that has multiple terms (constants, variables and exponents) like $f(x)=x^{2}+y+1$.          
+ Elements of ${\rm I\!R}^n$ - ordered sets of real numbers. A vector in ${\rm I\!R}^3$ has the shape below.  
$x = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  x_2 \\
  x_3
 \end{bmatrix}
 \in {\rm I\!R}^{3}$

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='markup', fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/03_vectors-types.jpg")
```

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Create a 3-dimensional vector in Python via Numpy ----------------------------
# Note the placement of double square brackets [[d1],[d2],[d3]]
import numpy as np

y = np.array([[1],
              [4],
              [7]])  
y.shape   
#> (3, 1)  
```


# Special vectors     

Special vectors include:  

+ Zero vectors - a vector which is only composed of zeros.  
$x = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  0
 \end{bmatrix}$  
+ Unit vectors - a vector containing a single element of 1 with remaining elements of zero. Useful for reducing the dimensions of a vector.  
$y = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  0 \\
  0
 \end{bmatrix}$   
+ Sparse vectors - a sparse vector is a 1D array of elements which predominantly contain zero values. To maximise computational efficiency, we can represent a sparse vector into a vector of (index, value) pairs.    
$[\,0,\,0,\,3,\,0,\,0,\,12,\,0,\,0,\,2\,] \to [\,[\,2,\,3\,],\,[\,5,\,12\,]\,[\,8,\,2\,]\,]$     


# Vector dimensions and the coordinate system   

Vectors can have any number of dimensions. We usually encounter examples in the 2D Cartesian plane or 3D space, as these can be visualised as geometric vectors. In machine learning, however, we often encounter problems involving tens, hundreds or even thousands of dimensions (where one dimension represents a unique feature).       

The notation of a vector $x$ with $n$ dimensions is written below.     
$x = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  x_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  x_n
 \end{bmatrix} \in {\rm I\!R}^{n}$  

Vector dimensions implicitly map into coordinate systems determined by underlying basis vectors, which have an origin at (0, 0, ..., 0).     
$x = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  2 \\
  3 
 \end{bmatrix} \in {\rm I\!R}^{3}$ can therefore also be described as a position within a 3-dimensional coordinate system i.e. starting at `(0, 0, 0)`, move `+1` units in the 1st axis, move `+2` units in the 2nd perpendicular axis and then move `+3` units in the 3rd perpendicular axis.    
 
 
# Basic vector operations   


## Vector-vector addition   

Vector-vector addition is performed element-wise and it only applies for vectors of the same size.    
 
$x + y = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  x_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  x_n
 \end{bmatrix}
 + 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  y_1 \\
  y_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  y_n
 \end{bmatrix} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 + y_1 \\
  x_2 + y_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  x_n + y_n  
 \end{bmatrix}$   
 
Vector-vector addition has the following properties:  

+ It is commutative. $x + y = y + x$      
+ It is associative. $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$       
+ Addition of the zero vector has no effect. $x + 0 = x$      
+ Subtracting the vector from itself returns the zero vector. $x - x = 0$       

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Create and add two vectors in Python via Numpy -------------------------------  
x = np.array([[1],
              [2],
              [3]])  

x.shape # 3-dimensional NumPy array  
#> (3, 1)

y = np.array([[1],
              [0],
              [-1]])

x + y
#> array([[2],
#>        [2],
#>        [2]])

np.add(x, y)
#> array([[2],
#>        [2],
#>        [2]])  
```

```{r}
# Create and add two vectors in R ----------------------------------------------  
# Vectors of n dimensions can be stored inside arrays    
# Arrays are not often used for analysis in R i.e. a matrix is used instead of a 2D array          

x <- array(c(1,
             2,
             3), 
           dim = c(3, 1, 1))

str(x)  
#>  num [1:3, 1, 1] 1 2 3

y <- array(c(1,
             0,
             -1), 
           dim = c(3, 1, 1))  

str(x + y) 
#>  num [1:3, 1, 1] 2 2 2    
```


## Vector-scalar multiplication  

Vector-scalar multiplication is also an element-wise operation.     

$\alpha x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
 \alpha x_1\\
 \alpha x_2\\
 \vdots \\
 \alpha x_n     
\end{bmatrix}$         

Vector-scalar multiplication has the following properties:   

+ It is associative. $(\alpha \times \beta )\times x = \alpha \times (\beta \times x)$        
+ It is left-distributive. $(\alpha + \beta )x = \alpha x + \beta x$       
+ It is right-distributive. $x(\alpha + \beta ) = x\alpha + x\beta$     
+ It is right-distributive for vector addition. $\alpha (x+y)=\alpha x+ \alpha y$     

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Vector-scalar multiplication in Python via Numpy -----------------------------
alpha = 4 

x = np.array([[1],
              [2],
              [3]])  
             
alpha * x    
#> array([[ 4],
#>        [ 8],
#>        [12]])
```

```{r}
# Vector-scalar multiplication in R --------------------------------------------  
alpha <- 4
x <- array(c(1,
             2,
             3), 
           dim = c(3, 1, 1))

str(alpha * x)  
#> num [1:3, 1, 1] 4 8 12  
```


## Vector linear combination        

A linear combination utilises the both rules of vector-vector addition and vector-scalar multiplication. 

There are a few different ways of thinking about linear combinations:  

+ Graphically as the addition of two vectors to form a new vector in the Cartesian plane. The linear combination of the basis vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ can be used to create any point in the 2D Cartesian plane.      
+ Mathematically as the proof that any new vector can be created by a scalar combination of two existing basis vectors.      

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='markup', fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/03_vectors-linear-combination.jpg")
```

Another way to express linear combinations is with summation notation as $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{k}\beta_{i}x_{i}$ where $i$ represents the total number of distinct scalars and vectors. Note that two linearly independent vectors do not need to be orthogonal to each other for the span of their linear combinations to be ${\rm I\!R}^2$.         

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Linear combination in Python via Numpy ---------------------------------------  
a, b = -2, 3 # Input scalar values  

x = np.array([[2],
              [3]])

y = np.array([[4],
              [5]])  

a*x + b*y
#> array([[8],
#>        [9]]) 

#> [[-4 + 12],
#>  [-6 + 15]]  
```

```{r}
# Linear combination in R ------------------------------------------------------ 
a <- -2
b <- 3

x <- array(c(2, 3), 
           dim = c(2, 1, 1))

y <- array(c(4, 5), 
           dim = c(2, 1, 1))

str(a*x + b*y)
#>  num [1:2, 1, 1] 8 9     
```


## Vector-vector multiplication (the dot-product)  

Finding the dot product (a scalar output) involves taking the transpose of the first vector and then calculating the sum of the product of each vector dimension. Later in this section on vectors, we will explore why the dot-product can be described as the projection of a vector onto a second vector multiplied by the length of the second vector.    

$$x\cdot y = \begin{bmatrix}
 x_1\\
 x_2\\
\end{bmatrix}^T \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
 y_1\\
 y_2\\
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
 x_1, x_2\\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot  
\begin{bmatrix}
 y_1\\
 y_2\\
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
(x_1\times y_1) + (x_2\times y_2)
\end{bmatrix}$$  

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='markup', fig.align='center', out.width='85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/03_vectors-dot-product.jpg")
```

**Note:** The dot product of two vectors will always return a  scalar (i.e. a single value). In machine learning, the dot product is a useful tool for understanding projections and testing whether two vectors point in the same direction.      

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Vector-vector multiplication in Python via Numpy -----------------------------  
x = np.array([[-2],
              [2]])  

y = np.array([[4],
              [-3]])  

np.transpose(x) # np.transpose(x) can also be written as x.T
#> array([[-2,  2]])    

np.transpose(x) @ y
#> array([[-14]])   
```

```{r}
# Vector-vector multiplication in R --------------------------------------------  
# t() only works on matrices so we need to create x and y as matrices     

x <- matrix(c(-2, 2), nrow = 2)
y <- matrix(c(4, -3), nrow = 2)

t(x) 
#>      [,1] [,2]
#> [1,]   -2    2  

t(x) %*% y
#>      [,1]
#> [1,]  -14
```


# Vector space, span and subspace     

A vector space is the set of proper vectors (objects which follow the rules defined for vector behaviour) and all possible linear combinations of the vector set.  


## Vector span  

If we take the basis vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ and the scalars $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the vector span is defined as the set of all possible linear combinations of $\alpha \hat{i} + \beta \hat{j}$.        

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='markup', fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/03_vectors-span.jpg")
```


## Vector subspace  

A vector subspace is a vector space that lies within a larger vector space.   

For a vector subspace $S$ to be valid, it has to meet three conditions:  

+ Contains the zero vector. $0\in S$     
+ Exhibits closure under multiplication i.e. $for\; all\; \alpha \in {\rm I\!R} \to \alpha \times s_i \in S$   
+ Exhibits closure under addition i.e. $for\; all\; s_i \in S \to s_1 + s_2 \in S$  

[Closure](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/closure.html) can be thought of as the inability to jump out from one space into another. For example, in the set of odd numbers, odd numbers exhibit closure under multiplication but not addition (multiplying odd numbers by odd numbers will always produce odd numbers).    

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='markup', fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/03_vectors-subspace.jpg")
```

There are two ways to think about vector subspaces:  

**Geometrically for 2D or 3D vectors**       

You can think about closure under multiplication or addition as the addition of two vectors in the Cartesian plane. This is slightly harder to visualise in 3D and impossible for vectors of higher dimensions.    
+ Closure by multiplication implies that if we take vector $x$ and multiply it by any real scalar, the resulting vector will stay in the span of ${\rm I\!R}^2$. This is because $\alpha \times x$ will only stretch the length and/or change the direction of $x$, so the resulting vector will not jump outside the 2D plane.    
+ Closure by addition is reflected by the observation that if we add together any vectors with the span of ${\rm I\!R}^2$, the resulting vector remains in the span of ${\rm I\!R}^2$.  

**Mathematically evaluating individual vectors**     

You can ask whether the vector $x= [\,1,\, 2\,]^\mathsf{T}$ is a valid subspace of ${\rm I\!R}^2$.     

+ Because the span of a vector is the set of all its linear combinations, the span of $x= [\,1,\, 2\,]^\mathsf{T}$ does contain zero.   
$0\times x=
0 \times 
\begin{bmatrix}
 1\\
 2\\
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
 0\\
 0\\
\end{bmatrix}$   

+ Multiplying a vector by a scalar produces a scaled version of the original vector which still exists within the 2D plane. $\alpha \times [\,1,\, 2\,]^\mathsf{T} = [\,\alpha \times 1,\, \alpha \times 2\,]^\mathsf{T}$      
+ Adding two vectors produces another vector which still exists within the 2D plane.  


# Linear dependence and linear independence    

A set of vectors is linearly dependent if at least one vector can be obtained as a linear combination of other vectors in the set. Another way to define linear dependence is to consider a set of vectors $x_1, ..., x_k$ and scalars $\beta \in {\rm I\!R}$.   

Linearly dependent vectors exist if we can obtain $0 = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{k} \beta_{i}x_{i}$ using at least one vector where $\beta \neq 0$.   

This implies that there is a vector in the same direction as a linear combination of other vectors. We can therefore rescale the linear combination of other vectors so it is in the opposite direction (but equal in magnitude) to the linearly dependent vector to obtain a sum of 0.       

A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector can be obtained from a linear combination of other vectors in the set.     

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='markup', fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/03_vectors-independence.jpg")   
```

To summarise, linearly dependent vectors contain redundant information and the span of linearly dependent vectors cannot cover the whole set of values in ${\rm I\!R}^n$. In contrast, linearly independent vectors do not contain redundant information.      


# Vector null space    

The null space of a set of vectors are all the linear combinations that map back into the zero vector.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='markup', fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../02_figures/03_vectors-null-space.jpg")   
```

In the example above, we can form the following two combinations of vectors that will map into the zero vector (0,0).
